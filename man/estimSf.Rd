\title{Estimate Size Factors using DESeq2 RLE Method}
\usage{
estimSf(cts)
}
\arguments{
\item{cts}{A matrix with count data.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of size factors for normalization.
}
\description{
Estimate size factors for normalization using the Relative Log Expression (RLE) method
as in the DESeq2 package.

This function computes size factors for normalization based on the DESeq2 RLE method.
Size factors are calculated as the median of the ratios of counts to their
geometric mean across all samples.
}
\details{
The DESeq2 RLE method estimates size factors for each sample based on
the relative log expression (RLE). The geometric mean of counts for each feature
across all samples is computed. Zero counts are set to NA to avoid division by zero.
Each count is then divided by its corresponding geometric mean, and the median
of these ratios across all samples is computed to obtain the size factor for each sample.
