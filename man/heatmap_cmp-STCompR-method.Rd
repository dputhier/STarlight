\usage{
\S4method{heatmap_cmp}{STCompR}(
  object,
  what = c("changes", "changes_2", "c1", "c2"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'STCompR'.}

\item{what}{A character string specifying what to plot: "changes" (the difference in manhattan distances between conditions 2 and 1),
"changes_2" (the difference in manhattan distances between conditions 1 and 2), "c1" (the manhattan distances of conditions 1), or "c2"
(the manhattan distances of conditions 2).}

\item{hclust_method}{A character string specifying the agglomerative criteria for hierarchical clustering ("ward.D", "ward.D2",
"single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median", "centroid").}

\item{dist_method}{A character string specifying the distance method to be used ("euclidean",
"maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary","minkowski").}

\item{del_feat}{A character vector specifying feature to be excluded from the heatmap.}

\item{only_feat}{A character vector specifying features to be included in the heatmap.}

\item{filter}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for filtering out low values in the heatmap.}

\item{size}{A numeric value specifying the size of text in the heatmap.}
}
\value{
A heatmap plot comparing conditions in the 'STCompR' object.
}
\description{
Generate a heatmap to visualize neighborhood changes between conditions.
The changes are computed as the difference in manhattan distances between the two conditions
stored in the object.

# Example usage:
heatmap_cmp(object = my_STCompR_object, hclust_method = "ward.D", dist_method = "euclidean")
